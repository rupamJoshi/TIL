## $PATH variable
When we use command `export PATH=$PATH:/opt/go/bin` it set the enviroment variable path and we can access `go` from anywhere. This will set the enviroment variable for single shell and if close it. You will have to set it again. 

In order to set the it permanently you have to edit the `/etc/enviroment` file and appen the path to bin for go there and it persist after you close the shell or shut down the system.
