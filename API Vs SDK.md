You have mobile app or a client service which wants to get information about today's weather. In order to do that it has to communicate with some service which provide the 
weather boardcast. Here to enable the communication between your app and the service providing the weather news, APIs and SDKs come into the picture. 

# API #
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It can be REST, GraphQL, etc but the basic concept is that you pass some parameters and in return you will receive a
response for your request. APIs have set of rules which are defined by one who is creating the API like parameter, content-type etc. It is a abstraction to the underline
operations processing happening to the data sent or posted. 

# SDK #
SDK stands for Software Development Kit. They are like tools or piece of code added to your code base and now you can use it to interact with API. Basically SDKs are making
the job easy for by making APIs call internally and you just have to call there method or functions. SDK are always made available for every language JAVA, NODE.js, GO.
